Co-occurrence relation:
    two vertices are connected if their corresponding lexical units co-occur within a window of max N words
    2 <= N <= 10
    express relation between syntactic elements + cohesion indicators
    restricted with syntactic filter ex) V : nouns, verbs / E : relation between nouns and verbs

Steps:
    1. text is tokenized, and annotated with part of speech tags / consider only single words as candidates for addition to the graph
    2. all lexicaal units that passes the syntactic filter are added to the graph / edge is added between those lexical units that co-occur within N words / initial score value of 1 / threshold of 0.0001
    3. sort the vertices in reverse order of their score / top T vertices in the ranking are retained for post-processing / T = |V| / 3
    4. mark the potential keywords / sequences of adjacent keywords are collapsed into a multi-word keyword => if chosen keywords are adjacent, suppose they are one key word
